January 24, 2020

-   Version 1.7.3
    -   Fix a bug in storing current session

November 12, 2019

-   Version 1.7.2
    -   Fix bug Regulon tab not showing for loom files not containing otif-based and track-based regulons.
-   Version 1.7.1
    -   Fix display of regulon target gene occurrences with loom containing motif-based and track-based regulons.

November 9, 2019

-   Version 1.7.0
    -   Display the regulon target gene occurrences when running SCENIC in multi-runs mode.

October 21, 2019

-   Version 1.6.0
    -   Allow renaming of file hierarchy levels from frontend

October 9, 2019

-   Version 1.5.0
    -   Add functionality for renaming clusters from the frontend on read-write looms
    -   Bump to loompy 3
    -   Small read/write bug fixes

October 1, 2019

-   Version 1.4.2
    -   Autodetect dimensionality reductions from column attributes with 'pca', 'tsne' or 'umap' in the name. NOTE: Extracts first 2 dimensions from attributes with >=2 dimensions. Therefore 3D dimensions may appear in the list but will show as 2D.

September 28, 2019

-   Version 1.4.1
    -   Fix bug in the query results (clusters) when searching a cluster which the queried gene is a marker for.

August 1, 2019

-   Version 1.4.0
    -   Enabled searching of regulons via their targetted genes
    -   Enabled searching of clusters by their marker genes
        -   Loom files containing many clusters will now search slower as a result
    -   General search space and search improvements
        -   Only build search space once per file on load
            -   Initial load times of a session may increase as a result, however time for searcing is halved as a result
        -   Reordering of search results
        -   Increased number of results returned when searching and enabled scroll bar
    -   EXPERIMENTAL: Enabled searching genes linked to regions for scATAC-seq data
        -   To enable this, a row attribute must be added called `linkedGene` containing a string of the gene linked to the region
    -   Allow display of Aertslab v9 motifs

July 18, 2019

-   Version 1.3.7
    -   Enabled read only sessions on the backend for permanent sessions
        -   Use by adding a tab-seperated value of either `ro` or `rw` to a session in Permanent_Sessions.txt in SCope config dir.
    -   No longer open looms as `rw` all the time to prevent corruption when closing the server.
    -   Converted logs from print statements to logging package.
    -   Various small fixes and dependancy issues.
    -   General code cleanup and PEP8 compliance changes

June 26, 2019

-   Version 1.3.6
    -   Allow for running in dev mode on AWS through `npm run scope-dev-aws` (useful for t2.micro AWS instance). See [here](https://bit.ly/2XsunFh) to start your own SCope instance running on AWS. Update related tutorials for AWS deployment.

December 14, 2018

-   Version 1.3.5
    -   Update Apache config to deploy SCope on secure protocol (e.g.: HTTPS). Update related tutorials for AWS deployment.

November 16, 2018

-   Version 1.3.4
    -   Fix some installation bugs.
    -   Fix bug Compare tab disabled when a .loom does not contain any meta data information (e.g.: annotations).

August 22, 2018

-   Version 1.3.2
    -   Fix bug downloading sub loom when parent loom is a public one.
    -   Fix bug downloading sub loom when parent loom has been created with SCopeLoomR version < 0.0.5.6558.
-   Version 1.3.1
    -   Fix bug when cluster markers not present in .loom.
-   Version 1.3.0
    -   Add feature to download subset of looms. Currently it is only possible to subset the active loom based on cluster information.

August 10, 2018

-   Version 1.2.1
    -   Fix bug when trajectory data not well defined in .loom.

July 6, 2018

-   Version 1.2.0
    -   Add feature to display trajectory data in the viewer. Currently the only way we provide to add trajectory data to .loom files is through [SCopeLoomR](https://github.com/aertslab/SCopeLoomR/).

July 4, 2018

-   Version 1.1.0
    -   Add feature to display metrics in the viewer. Currently the only way we provide to add metrics to .loom files is through [SCopeLoomR](https://github.com/aertslab/SCopeLoomR/).
